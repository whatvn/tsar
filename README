sar - A tool to collect, report, or save system activity information.


tsar is another version of sar. Tsar is Taobao monitor tool for collect system activity status, and report it.
It have a plugin system that is easy for collect plugin development. and may
setup different output target such as local logfile and remote nagios host.


tsar original version was created to collect Apache Traffic Server (http://trafficserver.apache.org) which installed as standar RedHat version.
I modified Taobao version to let tsar work with any kind of Apache Traffic server installation using ts_mng_socket section in tsar configuration file.

    ::Installation

    $ ./configure --libdir=$LIB_DIR_PREFIX
    $ make
    # make install 

    Modify ts_mng_socket location in /etc/tsar/tsar.conf 
    ===============================
    ts_mng_socket /var/trafficserver/run/mgmtapisocket
    ===============================
    Check
    # tsar --ts_cache -i 1 -l 

    Enjoy!
